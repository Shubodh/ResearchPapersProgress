# Research Papers 

A collection of research papers and books I read. This includes survey/tutorial papers as well. 

Fields: Robotics - SLAM, Computer Vision (v), Learning (l), Optimization (o) and related fields. 
read (r), ongoing (c) and to-read next (tr)   

Basic (B): Foundational papers in the above mentioned fields.  
Advanced (A): Self explanatory.   
Relevant (R): Relevant to my specialized sub-fields in robotics.   
Survey papers (S), Thesis (T), Vision (V), Tutorial papers (L) (Vision here as in "futuristic vision" and not "computer vision")
